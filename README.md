# Storyline
1) When Vedika and her team went under the water to research the city of Nereia, they found an extremely rare metal, called Nereium, which is found nowhere else in the world.
2) The team created a crypto coin called Nerit, where one Nerit was made to be equal to one gram of Nereium.
3) Furthermore, to make their job easier, they made a Web-Based platform in order to carry out their various research-based tasks, and a CLI to interact with the city and its inhabitants.

# Features (Web)
1) Firstly a member of the team must join the team on the Join Us page.
2) The Discoveries page allows researchers to post their theses on the platform itself. For a reader, the amount of text might be huge. Thus, we made an option to summarize the Discovery using the Gemini API.
3) On the Nerit page, users can manage all their cryptocurrency-related tasks in just a few clicks. We have integrated blockchain technology in order to make the transactions more secure.
4) The value of the Nerit keeps on increasing and decreasing, based on the number of Nerits exchanged on that particular day.
5) Researchers can hold auctions on the various items they collected on the Auctions page. Exchange of money in auctions will always be done in Nerits.
6) The Chat page allows researchers and divers to quickly communicate with each other without any hassle.
7) In case of an emergency, researchers and divers can use the SOS page to call for immediate help. Instant help will be provided to them in less than four minutes.

# Features (CLI)
1) The CLI allows the researchers to quickly interact with Nereians, and the city of Nereia.
2) Using the Communicate feature, researchers can initiate a communication session with Nereians and vice versa. The messages will be automatically translated to the preferred language of the user.
3) The Explore feature allows researchers to remotely explore the city of Nereia. They can view all the information they may need about the city, and easily interact with the city in a gamified way.

# Usage (CLI)
1) Clone the repository from the GitHub link
2) Go to the directory and run npm i -g
3) Then simply run exuncli help to explore the various commands.
